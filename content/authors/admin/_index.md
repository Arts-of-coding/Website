In 2016, I started the bachelor Biology at Utrecht University from which I obtained my bachelor's degree in 2019. I specialized in Cell Biology, Developmental Biology and Neurobiology. In these areas the molecular, genetic and epigenetic background is of great interest to me. I did my Bachelor's internship at the Hubrecht Institute in the Bakkers group. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree at Utrecht University in Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences. During my master's I was a research intern at the Korswagen group (Hubrecht Institute). I quickly became interested in Bioinformatics related topics within genetics. Currently, I'm following courses of the UBC Bioinformatics profile.

Furthermore, I worked at BlueLinked through the organization Advident and I have obtained a GIS (Geographic Information System) certificate during my bachelors. I am also member of ABC Taxus (Archery Club).
